# Tournament-Planner
Tournament Planner correspond to the second project within the Udacity FullStack Development Nanodegree

In Project 2, you will be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.
Project 2 was designed to teach you how to create and use databases through the use of database schemas and how to manipulate the data inside the database. This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing code that will use it to track a Swiss tournament.

##Requirements
1. Python 2.7
  * Bleach(see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach)
2. Postgress 9.3.6

##Installation
1. First execute tournament.sql to create the database and tables
2. Run tournament_test.py to verify everything is ok

##Now you are ready to create your own tournaments!!
just add even number of players, get them pair up and report matches results
