# tournament.py -- implementation of a Swiss-system tournament

'''
created by Tartufo Taruffetti
on April 29th, 2015
The python module was created to implement/develop the Second project of the
Udacity FullStack web Developer Nanodegree
it was tested agaisnt a Postgres 9.3.6 DDBB
In this project, youâ€™ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database 
to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.
The game tournament will use the Swiss system (See repo for details) for pairing up players in each round: 
players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with 
the same number of wins, or as close as possible.
This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and 
writing the code that will use it.
